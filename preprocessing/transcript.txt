 Hi! Today I'm going to teach you how to eat a bag of lace chips. First you have to open the bag. Then you have to take out a chip and then you have to put it in your mouth and then you have to chew it. And then you have to swallow it and then you have to stop eating it. And then because it's very salty I would highly recommend drinking a cup of water. Why would you want to eat a lace chip? Well there are many reasons. Scholars have looked throughout the ages for why someone would want to eat a lace chip and they've all come to one conclusion. It's very good. Unfortunately these are still and I don't know why. But they're usually very good and that's what scholars agree on. This was my presentation. My name is Wihi. Yes.
